I need to submit: 

makefile: which is a file that compiles and creates objects 
and all the files needed for the project, without having to manually do it. 
It as a set of rules that I decide. 
In this case they ask for NAME, all, clean, fclean and re.

libft.h: which is the library header file, where it lists the functions inside.

ft_*.c: all the function files.
